	<h3>Word Search Solver</h3>
	<p>Android and Windows App to solve word searches (find-a-words) from a picture.<br>
	Created with Python using Kivy, Open CV</p>


	<h5>Vision</h5>
	<p>The Final Vision system works by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First asking the user to select the area which the actual grid is, this was done instead of trying<br>to automatically determin where it is to increase reliability but does mean the system can not work on a live feed</li>
		<li>Second it preprocesses the image by applying a variety of effects including, blurring, greyscaling, thresholding and scaling down</li>
		<li>Third it finds all <a>contours</a> and filters the ones of roughly the right size</li>
		<li>Fourth It creates a small images fitted to each of the contours and passes them into a <a>K Nearest Neighbour</a> Classifer. The Knn classifier works by simply finding<br>
		the summed pixel difference between the given image and every image in an autogenerated dataset of labeled letters and gives you which letters it matches up to the best.</li>
		<li>Fifth it generates a grid by allocating letters based on their position in the image</li>
		<li>Finally it finds the given words in the grid by just checking for every grid location if any of the words are in any direction and annotating the origonal image to display back</li>
	</ul>
