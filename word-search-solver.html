	<h3>Word Search Solver</h3>
	<p>Android and Windows App to solve word searches (find-a-words) from a picture.<br>
	Created with Python using Kivy, Open CV</p>


	<h5>Vision</h5>
	<p>The Final Vision system works by:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>First it preprocesses the image by applying a variety of effects including, blurring, greyscaling, thresholding and scaling down</li>
		<li>Second it finds all <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/d4/d73/tutorial_py_contours_begin.html">contours</a> and filters them down to ones that are roughly the right size and shape</li>
		<li>Third it creates a small images fitted to each of the contours and places them into a grid</li>
		<li>Fourth it passes each image into a <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/d5/d26/tutorial_py_knn_understanding.html">K Nearest Neighbour</a> Classifer. The Knn classifier works by finding<br>
		the summed pixel difference between the given image and every image in an autogenerated dataset of labeled letters and gives you a list of the letters that match up the best.</li>
		<li>Finally it finds the given words in the grid by, for each word:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Finding all Knn matches for the first letter</li>
				<li>For each first letter found check all adjacent grid squares to see if they had any matches with the second letter</li>
				<li>Continue checking for all remaining letters in the same direction</li>
				<li>If you find all letters in a word, assign it a confidence based on how many of the Knn matches were for the letters used.</li>
				<li>The the word with the highest confidence.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
